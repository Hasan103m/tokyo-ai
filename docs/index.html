              AI Salon is a global community by and for AI-focused founders, builders, investors, and enterprise partners. The format is a monthly in-person event with lightning talks from startups with a presence in Japan, showing the products they are working on to other builders, partners, and investors. We sometimes have also foreign AI startups visiting Japan, as we want to be their lending pad in Tokyo. AI Salon has been launched in Austin (US) by Jeffrey Abbott, GP at Blitzscaling Ventures, who decided to partner for their Tokyo chapter with TAI through the JETRO patronage and DEEPCORE support.
